Such civil action shall proceed independently of any criminal prosecution (if the latter be instituted), and may be proved by a preponderance of evidence. </p>
</dir>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 528.</b> Possession acquired in good faith does not lose this character except in the case and from the moment facts exist which show that the possessor is not unaware that he possesses the thing improperly or wrongfully. (435a) </p>

<p align="center"><b>TITLE VII<br/>EASEMENTS OF SERVITUDES</b></p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 1<br/>Easements in General</b></p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 1<br/>Different Kinds of Easements</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 613.</b> An easement or servitude is an encumbrance imposed upon an immovable for the benefit of another immovable belonging to a different owner. </p>
<p align="justify">The immovable in favor of which the easement is established is called the dominant estate; that which is subject thereto, the servient estate. (530) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 614.</b> Servitudes may also be established for the benefit of a community, or of one or more persons to whom the encumbered estate does not belong. (531) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 615.</b> Easements may be continuous or discontinuous, apparent or nonapparent. </p>
<p align="justify">Continuous easements are those the use of which is or may be incessant, without the intervention of any act of man. </p>
<p align="justify">Discontinuous easements are those which are used at intervals and depend upon the acts of man. </p>
<p align="justify">Apparent easements are those which are made known and are continually kept in view by external signs that reveal the use and enjoyment of the same. </p>
<p align="justify">Nonapparent easements are those which show no external indication of their existence. (532) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 616.</b> Easements are also positive or negative. </p>
<p align="justify">A positive easement is one which imposes upon the owner of the servient estate the obligation of allowing something to be done or of doing it himself, and a negative easement, that which prohibits the owner of the servient estate from doing something which he could lawfully do if the easement did not exist. (533) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 617.</b> Easements are inseparable from the estate to which they actively or passively belong. (534) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 618.</b> Easements are indivisible. If the servient estate is divided between two or more persons, the easement is not modified, and each of them must bear it on the part which corresponds to him. </p>
<p align="justify">If it is the dominant estate that is divided between two or more persons, each of them may use the easement in its entirety, without changing the place of its use, or making it more burdensome in any other way. (535) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 619.</b> Easements are established either by law or by the will of the owners. The former are called legal and the latter voluntary easements. (536) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 2<br/>Modes of Acquiring Easements</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 620.</b> Continuous and apparent easements are acquired either by virtue of a title or by prescription of ten years. (537a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 621.</b> In order to acquire by prescription the easements referred to in the preceding article, the time of possession shall be computed thus: in positive easements, from the day on which the owner of the dominant estate, or the person who may have made use of the easement, commenced to exercise it upon the servient estate; and in negative easements, from the day on which the owner of the dominant estate forbade, by an instrument acknowledged before a notary public, the owner of the servient estate, from executing an act which would be lawful without the easement. (538a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 622.</b> Continuous nonapparent easements, and discontinuous ones, whether apparent or not, may be acquired only by virtue of a title. (539) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 623.</b> The absence of a document or proof showing the origin of an easement which cannot be acquired by prescription may be cured by a deed of recognition by the owner of the servient estate or by a final judgment. (540a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 624.</b> The existence of an apparent sign of easement between two estates, established or maintained by the owner of both, shall be considered, should either of them be alienated, as a title in order that the easement may continue actively and passively, unless, at the time the ownership of the two estates is divided, the contrary should be provided in the title of conveyance of either of them, or the sign aforesaid should be removed before the execution of the deed. This provision shall also apply in case of the division of a thing owned in common by two or more persons. (541a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 625.</b> Upon the establishment of an easement, all the rights necessary for its use are considered granted. (542) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 626.</b> The owner of the dominant estate cannot use the easement except for the benefit of the immovable originally contemplated. Neither can he exercise the easement in any other manner than that previously established. (n) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 3<br/>Rights and Obligations of the Owners of the Dominant and Servient Estates</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 627.</b> The owner of the dominant estate may make, at his own expense, on the servient estate any works necessary for the use and preservation of the servitude, but without altering it or rendering it more burdensome. </p>
<p align="justify">For this purpose he shall notify the owner of the servient estate, and shall choose the most convenient time and manner so as to cause the least inconvenience to the owner of the servient estate. (543a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 628.</b> Should there be several dominant estates, the owners of all of them shall be obliged to contribute to the expenses referred to in the preceding article, in proportion to the benefits which each may derive from the work. Any one who does not wish to contribute may exempt himself by renouncing the easement for the benefit of the others. </p>
<p align="justify">If the owner of the servient estate should make use of the easement in any manner whatsoever, he shall also be obliged to contribute to the expenses in the proportion stated, saving an agreement to the contrary. (544) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 629.</b> The owner of the servient estate cannot impair, in any manner whatsoever, the use of the servitude. </p>
<p align="justify">Nevertheless, if by reason of the place originally assigned, or of the manner established for the use of the easement, the same should become very inconvenient to the owner of the servient estate, or should prevent him from making any important works, repairs or improvements thereon, it may be changed at his expense, provided he offers another place or manner equally convenient and in such a way that no injury is caused thereby to the owner of the dominant estate or to those who may have a right to the use of the easement. (545) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 630.</b> The owner of the servient estate retains the ownership of the portion on which the easement is established, and may use the same in such a manner as not to affect the exercise of the easement. (n) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 4<br/>Modes of Extinguishment of Easements</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 631.</b> Easements are extinguished: </p>
<dir>

<p align="justify">(2) By nonuser for ten years; with respect to discontinuous easements, this period shall be computed from the day on which they ceased to be used; and, with respect to continuous easements, from the day on which an act contrary to the same took place; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) When either or both of the estates fall into such condition that the easement cannot be used; but it shall revive if the subsequent condition of the estates or either of them should again permit its use, unless when the use becomes possible, sufficient time for prescription has elapsed, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding number; </p>
<p align="justify">(4) By the expiration of the term or the fulfillment of the condition, if the easement is temporary or conditional; </p>
<p align="justify">(5) By the renunciation of the owner of the dominant estate; </p>
<p align="justify">(6) By the redemption agreed upon between the owners of the dominant and servient estates. (546a) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1083.</b> Every co-heir has a right to demand the division of the estate unless the testator should have expressly forbidden its partition, in which case the period of indivision shall not exceed twenty years as provided in article 494. This power of the testator to prohibit division applies to the legitime. </p>
<p align="justify">Even though forbidden by the testator, the co-ownership terminates when any of the causes for which partnership is dissolved takes place, or when the court finds for compelling reasons that division should be ordered, upon petition of one of the co-heirs. (1051a) </p>

<p align="justify">Co-heirs do not warrant bad debts, if so known to, and accepted by, the distributee. But if such debts are not assigned to a co-heir, and should be collected, in whole or in part, the amount collected shall be distributed proportionately among the heirs. (1072a) </p>

<p align="justify">(2) When it has been so expressly stipulated in the agreement of partition, unless there has been bad faith; </p>

<p align="center">Nature and Effect of Obligations</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1163.</b> Every person obliged to give something is also obliged to take care of it with the proper diligence of a good father of a family, unless the law or the stipulation of the parties requires another standard of care. (1094a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1164.</b> The creditor has a right to the fruits of the thing from the time the obligation to deliver it arises. However, he shall acquire no real right over it until the same has been delivered to him. (1095) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1165.</b> When what is to be delivered is a determinate thing, the creditor, in addition to the right granted him by article 1170, may compel the debtor to make the delivery. </p>
<p align="justify">If the thing is indeterminate or generic, he may ask that the obligation be complied with at the expense of the debtor. </p>
<p align="justify">If the obligor delays, or has promised to deliver the same thing to two or more persons who do not have the same interest, he shall be responsible for any fortuitous event until he has effected the delivery. (1096) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1166.</b> The obligation to give a determinate thing includes that of delivering all its accessions and accessories, even though they may not have been mentioned. (1097a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1167.</b> If a person obliged to do something fails to do it, the same shall be executed at his cost. </p>
<p align="justify">This same rule shall be observed if he does it in contravention of the tenor of the obligation. Furthermore, it may be decreed that what has been poorly done be undone. (1098) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1168.</b> When the obligation consists in not doing, and the obligor does what has been forbidden him, it shall also be undone at his expense. (1099a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1169.</b> Those obliged to deliver or to do something incur in delay from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands from them the fulfillment of their obligation. </p>
<p align="justify">However, the demand by the creditor shall not be necessary in order that delay may exist: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) When the obligation or the law expressly so declare; or </p>
<p align="justify">(2) When from the nature and the circumstances of the obligation it appears that the designation of the time when the thing is to be delivered or the service is to be rendered was a controlling motive for the establishment of the contract; or </p>
<p align="justify">(3) When demand would be useless, as when the obligor has rendered it beyond his power to perform. </p>
</dir>
<p align="justify">In reciprocal obligations, neither party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with what is incumbent upon him. From the moment one of the parties fulfills his obligation, delay by the other begins. (1100a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1170.</b> Those who in the performance of their obligations are guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay, and those who in any manner contravene the tenor thereof, are liable for damages. (1101) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1172.</b> Responsibility arising from negligence in the performance of every kind of obligation is also demandable, but such liability may be regulated by the courts, according to the circumstances. (1103) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1173.</b> The fault or negligence of the obligor consists in the omission of that diligence which is required by the nature of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of the persons, of the time and of the place. When negligence shows bad faith, the provisions of articles 1171 and 2201, paragraph 2, shall apply. </p>
<p align="justify">If the law or contract does not state the diligence which is to be observed in the performance, that which is expected of a good father of a family shall be required. (1104a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1174.</b> Except in cases expressly specified by the law, or when it is otherwise declared by stipulation, or when the nature of the obligation requires the assumption of risk, no person shall be responsible for those events which could not be foreseen, or which, though foreseen, were inevitable.

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1175.</b> Usurious transactions shall be governed by special laws. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1176.</b> The receipt of the principal by the creditor without reservation with respect to the interest, shall give rise to the presumption that said interest has been paid.</p>
<p align="justify">The receipt of a later installment of a debt without reservation as to prior installments, shall likewise raise the presumption that such installments have been paid. (1110a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1177.</b> The creditors, after having pursued the property in possession of the debtor to satisfy their claims, may exercise all the rights and bring all the actions of the latter for the same purpose, save those which are inherent in his person; they may also impugn the acts which the debtor may have done to defraud them.

<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 3<br/>Different Kinds of Obligations</b></p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 1<br/>Pure and Conditional Obligations</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1179.</b> Every obligation whose performance does not depend upon a future or uncertain event, or upon a past event unknown to the parties, is demandable at once. </p>
<p align="justify">Every obligation which contains a resolutory condition shall also be demandable, without prejudice to the effects of the happening of the event. (1113) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1180.</b> When the debtor binds himself to pay when his means permit him to do so, the obligation shall be deemed to be one with a period, subject to the provisions of article 1197. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1181.</b> In conditional obligations, the acquisition of rights, as well as the extinguishment or loss of those already acquired, shall depend upon the happening of the event which constitutes the condition. (1114) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1182.</b> When the fulfillment of the condition depends upon the sole will of the debtor, the conditional obligation shall be void. If it depends upon chance or upon the will of a third person, the obligation shall take effect in conformity with the provisions of this Code. (1115) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1183.</b> Impossible conditions, those contrary to good customs or public policy and those prohibited by law shall annul the obligation which depends upon them. If the obligation is divisible, that part thereof which is not affected by the impossible or unlawful condition shall be valid. </p>
<p align="justify">The condition not to do an impossible thing shall be considered as not having been agreed upon. (1116a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1184.</b> The condition that some event happen at a determinate time shall extinguish the obligation as soon as the time expires or if it has become indubitable that the event will not take place. (1117) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1185.</b> The condition that some event will not happen at a determinate time shall render the obligation effective from the moment the time indicated has elapsed, or if it has become evident that the event cannot occur. </p>
<p align="justify">If no time has been fixed, the condition shall be deemed fulfilled at such time as may have probably been contemplated, bearing in mind the nature of the obligation. (1118) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1186.</b> The condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment. (1119) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1187.</b> The effects of a conditional obligation to give, once the condition has been fulfilled, shall retroact to the day of the constitution of the obligation. Nevertheless, when the obligation imposes reciprocal prestations upon the parties, the fruits and interests during the pendency of the condition shall be deemed to have been mutually compensated. If the obligation is unilateral, the debtor shall appropriate the fruits and interests received, unless from the nature and circumstances of the obligation it should be inferred that the intention of the person constituting the same was different. </p>
<p align="justify">In obligations to do and not to do, the courts shall determine, in each case, the retroactive effect of the condition that has been complied with. (1120) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1188.</b> The creditor may, before the fulfillment of the condition, bring the appropriate actions for the preservation of his right. </p>
<p align="justify">The debtor may recover what during the same time he has paid by mistake in case of a suspensive condition. (1121a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1189.</b> When the conditions have been imposed with the intention of suspending the efficacy of an obligation to give, the following rules shall be observed in case of the improvement, loss or deterioration of the thing during the pendency of the condition: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) If the thing is lost without the fault of the debtor, the obligation shall be extinguished; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) If the thing is lost through the fault of the debtor, he shall be obliged to pay damages; it is understood that the thing is lost when it perishes, or goes out of commerce, or disappears in such a way that its existence is unknown or it cannot be recovered; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) When the thing deteriorates without the fault of the debtor, the impairment is to be borne by the creditor; </p>
<p align="justify">(4) If it deteriorates through the fault of the debtor, the creditor may choose between the rescission of the obligation and its fulfillment, with indemnity for damages in either case; </p>
<p align="justify">(5) If the thing is improved by its nature, or by time, the improvement shall inure to the benefit of the creditor; </p>
<p align="justify">(6) If it is improved at the expense of the debtor, he shall have no other right than that granted to the usufructuary. (1122) </p>
</dir>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1190.</b> When the conditions have for their purpose the extinguishment of an obligation to give, the parties, upon the fulfillment of said conditions, shall return to each other what they have received. </p>
<p align="justify">In case of the loss, deterioration or improvement of the thing, the provisions which, with respect to the debtor, are laid down in the preceding article shall be applied to the party who is bound to return. </p>
<p align="justify">As for the obligations to do and not to do, the provisions of the second paragraph of article 1187 shall be observed as regards the effect of the extinguishment of the obligation. (1123) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1191.</b> The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him. </p>
<p align="justify">The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible. </p>
<p align="justify">The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period. </p>
<p align="justify">This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with articles 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law. (1124) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1192.</b> In case both parties have committed a breach of the obligation, the liability of the first infractor shall be equitably tempered by the courts. If it cannot be determined which of the parties first violated the contract, the same shall be deemed extinguished, and each shall bear his own damages. (n) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 2<br/>Obligations with a Period</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1193.</b> Obligations for whose fulfillment a day certain has been fixed, shall be demandable only when that day comes. </p>
<p align="justify">Obligations with a resolutory period take effect at once, but terminate upon arrival of the day certain. </p>
<p align="justify">A day certain is understood to be that which must necessarily come, although it may not be known when. </p>
<p align="justify">If the uncertainty consists in whether the day will come or not, the obligation is conditional, and it shall be regulated by the rules of the preceding Section. (1125a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1194.</b> In case of loss, deterioration or improvement of the thing before the arrival of the day certain, the rules in article 1189 shall be observed. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1195.</b> Anything paid or delivered before the arrival of the period, the obligor being unaware of the period or believing that the obligation has become due and demandable, may be recovered, with the fruits and interests. (1126a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1196.</b> Whenever in an obligation a period is designated, it is presumed to have been established for the benefit of both the creditor and the debtor, unless from the tenor of the same or other circumstances it should appear that the period has been established in favor of one or of the other. (1127) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1197.</b> If the obligation does not fix a period, but from its nature and the circumstances it can be inferred that a period was intended, the courts may fix the duration thereof. </p>
<p align="justify">The courts shall also fix the duration of the period when it depends upon the will of the debtor. </p>
<p align="justify">In every case, the courts shall determine such period as may under the circumstances have been probably contemplated by the parties. Once fixed by the courts, the period cannot be changed by them. (1128a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1198.</b> The debtor shall lose every right to make use of the period: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) When after the obligation has been contracted, he becomes insolvent, unless he gives a guaranty or security for the debt; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) When he does not furnish to the creditor the guaranties or securities which he has promised; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) When by his own acts he has impaired said guaranties or securities after their establishment, and when through a fortuitous event they disappear, unless he immediately gives new ones equally satisfactory; </p>
<p align="justify">(4) When the debtor violates any undertaking, in consideration of which the creditor agreed to the period; </p>
<p align="justify">(5) When the debtor attempts to abscond. (1129a) </p></dir>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 3<br/>Alternative Obligations</b></p>
<p>ARTICLE 1199. A person alternatively bound by different prestations shall completely perform one of them. </p>
<p align="justify">The creditor cannot be compelled to receive part of one and part of the other undertaking. (1131) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1200.</b> The right of choice belongs to the debtor, unless it has been expressly granted to the creditor. </p>
<p align="justify">The debtor shall have no right to choose those prestations which are impossible, unlawful or which could not have been the object of the obligation. (1132) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1201.</b> The choice shall produce no effect except from the time it has been communicated. (1133) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1202.</b> The debtor shall lose the right of choice when among the prestations whereby he is alternatively bound, only one is practicable. (1134) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1203.</b> If through the creditor's acts the debtor cannot make a choice according to the terms of the obligation, the latter may rescind the contract with damages. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1204.</b> The creditor shall have a right to indemnity for damages when, through the fault of the debtor, all the things which are alternatively the object of the obligation have been lost, or the compliance of the obligation has become impossible. </p>
<p align="justify">The indemnity shall be fixed taking as a basis the value of the last thing which disappeared, or that of the service which last became impossible. </p>
<p align="justify">Damages other than the value of the last thing or service may also be awarded. (1135a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1205.</b> When the choice has been expressly given to the creditor, the obligation shall cease to be alternative from the day when the selection has been communicated to the debtor. </p>
<p align="justify">Until then the responsibility of the debtor shall be governed by the following rules: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) If one of the things is lost through a fortuitous event, he shall perform the obligation by delivering that which the creditor should choose from among the remainder, or that which remains if only one subsists; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) If the loss of one of the things occurs through the fault of the debtor, the creditor may claim any of those subsisting, or the price of that which, through the fault of the former, has disappeared, with a right to damages; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) If all the things are lost through the fault of the debtor, the choice by the creditor shall fall upon the price of any one of them, also with indemnity for damages. </p>
</dir>
<p align="justify">The same rules shall be applied to obligations to do or not to do in case one, some or all of the prestations should become impossible. (1136a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1206.</b> When only one prestation has been agreed upon, but the obligor may render another in substitution, the obligation is called facultative. </p>
<p align="justify">The loss or deterioration of the thing intended as a substitute, through the negligence of the obligor, does not render him liable. But once the substitution has been made, the obligor is liable for the loss of the substitute on account of his delay, negligence or fraud. (n) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 4<br/>Joint and Solidary Obligations</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1207.</b>	The concurrence of two or more creditors or of two or more debtors in one and the same obligation does not imply that each one of the former has a right to demand, or that each one of the latter is bound to render, entire compliance with the prestation. There is a solidary liability only when the obligation expressly so states, or when the law or the nature of the obligation requires solidarity. (1137a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1208.</b> If from the law, or the nature or the wording of the obligations to which the preceding article refers the contrary does not appear, the credit or debt shall be presumed to be divided into as many shares as there are creditors or debtors, the credits or debts being considered distinct from one another, subject to the Rules of Court governing the multiplicity of suits. (1138a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1209.</b> If the division is impossible, the right of the creditors may be prejudiced only by their collective acts, and the debt can be enforced only by proceeding against all the debtors. If one of the latter should be insolvent, the others shall not be liable for his share. (1139) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1210.</b> The indivisibility of an obligation does not necessarily give rise to solidarity. Nor does solidarity of itself imply indivisibility. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1211.</b> Solidarity may exist although the creditors and the debtors may not be bound in the same manner and by the same periods and conditions. (1140) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1212.</b> Each one of the solidary creditors may do whatever may be useful to the others, but not anything which may be prejudicial to the latter. (1141a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1213.</b> A solidary creditor cannot assign his rights without the consent of the others. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1214.</b> The debtor may pay any one of the solidary creditors; but if any demand, judicial or extrajudicial, has been made by one of them, payment should be made to him. (1142a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1215.</b> Novation, compensation, confusion or remission of the debt, made by any of the solidary creditors or with any of the solidary debtors, shall extinguish the obligation, without prejudice to the provisions of article 1219. </p>
<p align="justify">The creditor who may have executed any of these acts, as well as he who collects the debt, shall be liable to the others for the share in the obligation corresponding to them. (1143) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1216.</b> The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously. The demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to those which may subsequently be directed against the others, so long as the debt has not been fully collected. (1144a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1217.</b> Payment made by one of the solidary debtors extinguishes the obligation. If two or more solidary debtors offer to pay, the creditor may choose which offer to accept. </p>
<p align="justify">He who made the payment may claim from his co-debtors only the share which corresponds to each, with the interest for the payment already made. If the payment is made before the debt is due, no interest for the intervening period may be demanded. </p>
<p align="justify">When one of the solidary debtors cannot, because of his insolvency, reimburse his share to the debtor paying the obligation, such share shall be borne by all his co-debtors, in proportion to the debt of each. (1145a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1218.</b> Payment by a solidary debtor shall not entitle him to reimbursement from his co-debtors if such payment is made after the obligation has prescribed or become illegal. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1219.</b> The remission made by the creditor of the share which affects one of the solidary debtors does not release the latter from his responsibility towards the co-debtors, in case the debt had been totally paid by anyone of them before the remission was effected. (1146a)</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1220.</b> The remission of the whole obligation, obtained by one of the solidary debtors, does not entitle him to reimbursement from his co-debtors. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1221.</b> If the thing has been lost or if the prestation has become impossible without the fault of the solidary debtors, the obligation shall be extinguished. </p>
<p align="justify">If there was fault on the part of any one of them, all shall be responsible to the creditor, for the price and the payment of damages and interest, without prejudice to their action against the guilty or negligent debtor. </p>
<p align="justify">If through a fortuitous event, the thing is lost or the performance has become impossible after one of the solidary debtors has incurred in delay through the judicial or extrajudicial demand upon him by the creditor, the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply. (1147a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1222.</b> A solidary debtor may, in actions filed by the creditor, avail himself of all defenses which are derived from the nature of the obligation and of those which are personal to him, or pertain to his own share. With respect to those which personally belong to the others, he may avail himself thereof only as regards that part of the debt for which the latter are responsible. (1148a) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 5<br/>Divisible and Indivisible Obligations</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1223.</b> The divisibility or indivisibility of the things that are the object of obligations in which there is only one debtor and only one creditor does not alter or modify the provisions of Chapter 2 of this Title. (1149) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1224.</b> A joint indivisible obligation gives rise to indemnity for damages from the time anyone of the debtors does not comply with his undertaking. The debtors who may have been ready to fulfill their promises shall not contribute to the indemnity beyond the corresponding portion of the price of the thing or of the value of the service in which the obligation consists. (1150) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1225.</b> For the purposes of the preceding articles, obligations to give definite things and those which are not susceptible of partial performance shall be deemed to be indivisible. </p>
<p align="justify">When the obligation has for its object the execution of a certain number of days of work, the accomplishment of work by metrical units, or analogous things which by their nature are susceptible of partial performance, it shall be divisible. </p>
<p align="justify">However, even though the object or service may be physically divisible, an obligation is indivisible if so provided by law or intended by the parties. </p>
<p align="justify">In obligations not to do, divisibility or indivisibility shall be determined by the character of the prestation in each particular case. (1151a) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 6<br/>Obligations with a Penal Clause</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1226.</b> In obligations with a penal clause, the penalty shall substitute the indemnity for damages and the payment of interests in case of noncompliance, if there is no stipulation to the contrary. Nevertheless, damages shall be paid if the obligor refuses to pay the penalty or is guilty of fraud in the fulfillment of the obligation. </p>
<p align="justify">The penalty may be enforced only when it is demandable in accordance with the provisions of this Code. (1152a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1227.</b> The debtor cannot exempt himself from the performance of the obligation by paying the penalty, save in the case where this right has been expressly reserved for him. Neither can the creditor demand the fulfillment of the obligation and the satisfaction of the penalty at the same time, unless this right has been clearly granted him. However, if after the creditor has decided to require the fulfillment of the obligation, the performance thereof should become impossible without his fault, the penalty may be enforced. (1153a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1228.</b> Proof of actual damages suffered by the creditor is not necessary in order that the penalty may be demanded. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1229.</b> The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable. (1154a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1230.</b> The nullity of the penal clause does not carry with it that of the principal obligation. </p>
<p align="justify">The nullity of the principal obligation carries with it that of the penal clause. (1155) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1262.</b> An obligation which consists in the delivery of a determinate thing shall be extinguished if it should be lost or destroyed without the fault of the debtor, and before he has incurred in delay. </p>
<p align="justify">When by law or stipulation, the obligor is liable even for fortuitous events, the loss of the thing does not extinguish the obligation, and he shall be responsible for damages. The same rule applies when the nature of the obligation requires the assumption of risk. (1182a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1263.</b> In an obligation to deliver a generic thing, the loss or destruction of anything of the same kind does not extinguish the obligation. (n) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1265.</b> Whenever the thing is lost in the possession of the debtor, it shall be presumed that the loss was due to his fault, unless there is proof to the contrary, and without prejudice to the provisions of article 1165.

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1271.</b> The delivery of a private document evidencing a credit, made voluntarily by the creditor to the debtor, implies the renunciation of the action which the former had against the latter. </p>
<p align="justify">If in order to nullify this waiver it should be claimed to be inofficious, the debtor and his heirs may uphold it by proving that the delivery of the document was made in virtue of payment of the debt. (1188) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1272.</b> Whenever the private document in which the debt appears is found in the possession of the debtor, it shall be presumed that the creditor delivered it voluntarily, unless the contrary is proved. (1189) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1276.</b> Merger which takes place in the person of the principal debtor or creditor benefits the guarantors. Confusion which takes place in the person of any of the latter does not extinguish the obligation. (1193) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1277.</b> Confusion does not extinguish a joint obligation except as regards the share corresponding to the creditor or debtor in whom the two characters concur. (1194) </p>

<p align="justify">Mistake as to the identity or qualifications of one of the parties will vitiate consent only when such identity or qualifications have been the principal cause of the contract. </p>
<p align="justify">A simple mistake of account shall give rise to its correction. (1266a)</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1332.</b> When one of the parties is unable to read, or if the contract is in a language not understood by him, and mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract must show that the terms thereof have been fully explained to the former. (n) </p>

<br/>
<p align="center"><b>SECTION 3<br/>Cause of Contracts</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1350.</b> In onerous contracts the cause is understood to be, for each contracting party, the prestation or promise of a thing or service by the other; in remuneratory ones, the service or benefit which is remunerated; and in contracts of pure beneficence, the mere liberality of the benefactor.

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1356.</b> Contracts shall be obligatory, in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present. However, when the law requires that a contract be in some form in order that it may be valid or enforceable, or that a contract be proved in a certain way, that requirement is absolute and indispensable. In such cases, the right of the parties stated in the following article cannot be exercised. (1278a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1357.</b> If the law requires a document or other special form, as in the acts and contracts enumerated in the following article, the contracting parties may compel each other to observe that form, once the contract has been perfected. This right may be exercised simultaneously with the action upon the contract. (1279a) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1359.</b> When, there having been a meeting of the minds of the parties to a contract, their true intention is not expressed in the instrument purporting to embody the agreement, by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or accident, one of the parties may ask for the reformation of the instrument to the end that such true intention may be expressed. </p>
<p align="justify">If mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct, or accident has prevented a meeting of the minds of the parties, the proper remedy is not reformation of the instrument but annulment of the contract. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1360.</b> The principles of the general law on the reformation of instruments are hereby adopted insofar as they are not in conflict with the provisions of this Code. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1361.</b> When a mutual mistake of the parties causes the failure of the instrument to disclose their real agreement, said instrument may be reformed. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1362.</b> If one party was mistaken and the other acted fraudulently or inequitably in such a way that the instrument does not show their true intention, the former may ask for the reformation of the instrument. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1363.</b> When one party was mistaken and the other knew or believed that the instrument did not state their real agreement, but concealed that fact from the former, the instrument may be reformed. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1364.</b> When through the ignorance, lack of skill, negligence or bad faith on the part of the person drafting the instrument or of the clerk or typist, the instrument does not express the true intention of the parties, the courts may order that the instrument be reformed. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1365.</b> If two parties agree upon the mortgage or pledge of real or personal property, but the instrument states that the property is sold absolutely or with a right of repurchase, reformation of the instrument is proper. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1366.</b> There shall be no reformation in the following cases: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) Simple donations inter vivos wherein no condition is imposed; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Wills; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) When the real agreement is void. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1367.</b> When one of the parties has brought an action to enforce the instrument, he cannot subsequently ask for its reformation. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1368.</b> Reformation may be ordered at the instance of either party or his successors in interest, if the mistake was mutual; otherwise, upon petition of the injured party, or his heirs and assigns. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1369.</b> The procedure for the reformation of instrument shall be governed by rules of court to be promulgated by the Supreme Court. </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 5<br/>Interpretation of Contracts</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1370.</b> If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control. </p>
<p align="justify">If the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former. (1281) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1371.</b> In order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered. (1282) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1372.</b> However general the terms of a contract may be, they shall not be understood to comprehend things that are distinct and cases that are different from those upon which the parties intended to agree. (1283) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1373.</b> If some stipulation of any contract should admit of several meanings, it shall be understood as bearing that import which is most adequate to render it effectual. (1284) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1374.</b> The various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly. (1285) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1375.</b> Words which may have different significations shall be understood in that which is most in keeping with the nature and object of the contract. (1286) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1376.</b> The usage or custom of the place shall be borne in mind in the interpretation of the ambiguities of a contract, and shall fill the omission of stipulations which are ordinarily established. (1287) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1377.</b> The interpretation of obscure words or stipulations in a contract shall not favor the party who caused the obscurity. (1288) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1378.</b> When it is absolutely impossible to settle doubts by the rules established in the preceding articles, and the doubts refer to incidental circumstances of a gratuitous contract, the least transmission of rights and interests shall prevail. If the contract is onerous, the doubt shall be settled in favor of the greatest reciprocity of interests. </p>
<p align="justify">If the doubts are cast upon the principal object of the contract in such a way that it cannot be known what may have been the intention or will of the parties, the contract shall be null and void. (1289) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1379.</b> The principles of interpretation stated in Rule 123 of the Rules of Court shall likewise be observed in the construction of contracts. (n) </p>

<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 6<br/>Rescissible Contracts</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1380.</b> Contracts validly agreed upon may be rescinded in the cases established by law. (1290) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1381.</b> The following contracts are rescissible: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) Those which are entered into by guardians whenever the wards whom they represent suffer lesion by more than one-fourth of the value of the things which are the object thereof; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Those agreed upon in representation of absentees, if the latter suffer the lesion stated in the preceding number; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Those undertaken in fraud of creditors when the latter cannot in any other manner collect the claims due them; </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Those which refer to things under litigation if they have been entered into by the defendant without the knowledge and approval of the litigants or of competent judicial authority; </p>
<p align="justify">(5) All other contracts specially declared by law to be subject to rescission. (1291a) </p>
</dir>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1382.</b> Payments made in a state of insolvency for obligations to whose fulfillment the debtor could not be compelled at the time they were effected, are also rescissible. (1292) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1383.</b> The action for rescission is subsidiary; it cannot be instituted except when the party suffering damage has no other legal means to obtain reparation for the same. (1294) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1384.</b> Rescission shall be only to the extent necessary to cover the damages caused. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1385.</b> Rescission creates the obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract, together with their fruits, and the price with its interest; consequently, it can be carried out only when he who demands rescission can return whatever he may be obliged to restore. </p>
<p align="justify">Neither shall rescission take place when the things which are the object of the contract are legally in the possession of third persons who did not act in bad faith. </p>
<p align="justify">In this case, indemnity for damages may be demanded from the person causing the loss. (1295) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1386.</b> Rescission referred to in Nos. 1 and 2 of article 1381 shall not take place with respect to contracts approved by the courts. (1296a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1387.</b> All contracts by virtue of which the debtor alienates property by gratuitous title are presumed to have been entered into in fraud of creditors, when the donor did not reserve sufficient property to pay all debts contracted before the donation. </p>
<p align="justify">Alienations by onerous title are also presumed fraudulent when made by persons against whom some judgment has been rendered in any instance or some writ of attachment has been issued. The decision or attachment need not refer to the property alienated, and need not have been obtained by the party seeking the rescission. </p>
<p align="justify">In addition to these presumptions, the design to defraud creditors may be proved in any other manner recognized by the law of evidence. (1297a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1388.</b> Whoever acquires in bad faith the things alienated in fraud of creditors, shall indemnify the latter for damages suffered by them on account of the alienation, whenever, due to any cause, it should be impossible for him to return them. </p>
<p align="justify">If there are two or more alienations, the first acquirer shall be liable first, and so on successively. (1298a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1389.</b> The action to claim rescission must be commenced within four years. </p>
<p align="justify">For persons under guardianship and for absentees, the period of four years shall not begin until the termination of the former's incapacity, or until the domicile of the latter is known. (1299) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 7<br/>Voidable Contracts</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1390.</b> The following contracts are voidable or annullable, even though there may have been no damage to the contracting parties: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) Those where one of the parties is incapable of giving consent to a contract; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">These contracts are binding, unless they are annulled by a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification. (n) </p>
</dir>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1391.</b> The action for annulment shall be brought within four years. </p>
<p align="justify">This period shall begin: </p>

<p align="justify">In case of mistake or fraud, from the time of the discovery of the same. </p>
<p align="justify">And when the action refers to contracts entered into by minors or other incapacitated persons, from the time the guardianship ceases. (1301a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1392.</b> Ratification extinguishes the action to annul a voidable contract. (1309a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1393.</b> Ratification may be effected expressly or tacitly. It is understood that there is a tacit ratification if, with knowledge of the reason which renders the contract voidable and such reason having ceased, the person who has a right to invoke it should execute an act which necessarily implies an intention to waive his right. (1311a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1394.</b> Ratification may be effected by the guardian of the incapacitated person. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1395.</b> Ratification does not require the conformity of the contracting party who has no right to bring the action for annulment. (1312) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1396.</b> Ratification cleanses the contract from all its defects from the moment it was constituted. (1313) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1397.</b> The action for the annulment of contracts may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily. However, persons who are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; nor can those who exerted intimidation, violence, or undue influence, or employed fraud, or caused mistake base their action upon these flaws of the contract. (1302a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1398.</b> An obligation having been annulled, the contracting parties shall restore to each other the things which have been the subject matter of the contract, with their fruits, and the price with its interest, except in cases provided by law. </p>
<p align="justify">In obligations to render service, the value thereof shall be the basis for damages. (1303a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1399.</b> When the defect of the contract consists in the incapacity of one of the parties, the incapacitated person is not obliged to make any restitution except insofar as he has been benefited by the thing or price received by him. (1304) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1400.</b> Whenever the person obliged by the decree of annulment to return the thing can not do so because it has been lost through his fault, he shall return the fruits received and the value of the thing at the time of the loss, with interest from the same date. (1307a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1401.</b> The action for annulment of contracts shall be extinguished when the thing which is the object thereof is lost through the fraud or fault of the person who has a right to institute the proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify">If the right of action is based upon the incapacity of any one of the contracting parties, the loss of the thing shall not be an obstacle to the success of the action, unless said loss took place through the fraud or fault of the plaintiff. (1314a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1402.</b> As long as one of the contracting parties does not restore what in virtue of the decree of annulment he is bound to return, the other cannot be compelled to comply with what is incumbent upon him. (1308) </p>

Moreover, the provisions of the Penal Code relative to the disposal of effects or instruments of a crime shall be applicable to the things or the price of the contract. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1583.</b> Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by installments. </p>

(n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1584.</b> Where goods are delivered to the buyer, which he has not previously examined, he is not deemed to have accepted them unless and until he has had a reasonable opportunity of examining them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract if there is no stipulation to the contrary. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1586.</b> In the absence of express or implied agreement of the parties, acceptance of the goods by the buyer shall not discharge the seller from liability in damages or other legal remedy for breach of any promise or warranty in the contract of sale.

<p align="justify"><b>Article 1587.</b> Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are delivered to the buyer, and he refuses to accept them, having the right so to do, he is not bound to return them to the seller, but it is sufficient if he notifies the seller that he refuses to accept them.

A mere act of trespass shall not authorize the suspension of the payment of the price. (1502a) </p>

After the demand, the court may not grant him a new term. (1504a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1593.</b> With respect to movable property, the rescission of the sale shall of right take place in the interest of the vendor, if the vendee, upon the expiration of the period fixed for the delivery of the thing, should not have appeared to receive it, or, having appeared, he should not have tendered the price at the same time, unless a longer period has been stipulated for its payment.

<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 6<br/>Actions for Breach of Contract of Sale of Goods</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1594.</b> Actions for breach of the contract of sale of goods shall be governed particularly by the provisions of this Chapter, and as to matters not specifically provided for herein, by other applicable provisions of this Title. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1595.</b> Where, under a contract of sale, the ownership of the goods has passed to the buyer and he wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay for the goods according to the terms of the contract of sale, the seller may maintain an action against him for the price of the goods. </p>
<p align="justify">Where, under a contract of sale, the price is payable on a certain day, irrespective of delivery or of transfer of title and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay such price, the seller may maintain an action for the price although the ownership in the goods has not passed. But it shall be a defense to such an action that the seller at any time before the judgment in such action has manifested an inability to perform the contract of sale on his part or an intention not to perform it. </p>
<p align="justify">Although the ownership in the goods has not passed, if they cannot readily be resold for a reasonable price, and if the provisions of article 1596, fourth paragraph, are not applicable, the seller may offer to deliver the goods to the buyer, and, if the buyer refuses to receive them, may notify the buyer that the goods are thereafter held by the seller as bailee for the buyer. Thereafter the seller may treat the goods as the buyer's and may maintain an action for the price. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1596.</b> Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may maintain an action against him for damages for nonacceptance. </p>
<p align="justify">The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the buyer's breach of contract. </p>
<p align="justify">Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of special circumstances showing proximate damage of a different amount, the difference between the contract price and the market or current price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted, or, if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at the time of the refusal to accept. </p>
<p align="justify">If, while labor or expense of material amount is necessary on the part of the seller to enable him to fulfill his obligations under the contract of sale, the buyer repudiates the contract or notifies the seller to proceed no further therewith, the buyer shall be liable to the seller for labor performed or expenses made before receiving notice of the buyer's repudiation or countermand. The profit the seller would have made if the contract or the sale had been fully performed shall be considered in awarding the damages. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1597.</b> Where the goods have not been delivered to the buyer, and the buyer has repudiated the contract of sale, or has manifested his inability to perform his obligations thereunder, or has committed a breach thereof, the seller may totally rescind the contract of sale by giving notice of his election so to do to the buyer. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1598.</b> Where the seller has broken a contract to deliver specific or ascertained goods, a court may, on the application of the buyer, direct that the contract shall be performed specifically, without giving the seller the option of retaining the goods on payment of damages. The judgment or decree may be unconditional, or upon such terms and conditions as to damages, payment of the price and otherwise, as the court may deem just. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 1599.</b> Where there is a breach of warranty by the seller, the buyer may, at his election: </p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">(1) Accept or keep the goods and set up against the seller, the breach of warranty by way of recoupment in diminution or extinction of the price; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Accept or keep the goods and maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Refuse to accept the goods, and maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty; </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Rescind the contract of sale and refuse to receive the goods or if the goods have already been received, return them or offer to return them to the seller and recover the price or any part thereof which has been paid. </p>
<p align="justify">When the buyer has claimed and been granted a remedy in anyone of these ways, no other remedy can thereafter be granted, without prejudice to the provisions of the second paragraph of article 1191. </p>
<p align="justify">Where the goods have been delivered to the buyer, he cannot rescind the sale if he knew of the breach of warranty when he accepted the goods without protest, or if he fails to notify the seller within a reasonable time of the election to rescind, or if he fails to return or to offer to return the goods to the seller in substantially as good condition as they were in at the time the ownership was transferred to the buyer. But if deterioration or injury of the goods is due to the breach or warranty, such deterioration or injury shall not prevent the buyer from returning or offering to return the goods to the seller and rescinding the sale. </p>
<p align="justify">Where the buyer is entitled to rescind the sale and elects to do so, he shall cease to be liable for the price upon returning or offering to return the goods. If the price or any part thereof has already been paid, the seller shall be liable to repay so much thereof as has been paid, concurrently with the return of the goods, or immediately after an offer to return the goods in exchange for repayment of the price. </p>
<p align="justify">Where the buyer is entitled to rescind the sale and elects to do so, if the seller refuses to accept an offer of the buyer to return the goods, the buyer shall thereafter be deemed to hold the goods as bailee for the seller, but subject to a lien to secure the payment of any portion of the price which has been paid, and with the remedies for the enforcement of such lien allowed to an unpaid seller by article 1526. </p>
<p align="justify">(5) In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss, in the absence of special circumstances showing proximate damage of a greater amount, is the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.

<br/>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 1<br/>Provisions Common to Pledge and Mortgage</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2085.</b> The following requisites are essential to the contracts of pledge and mortgage: </p>
<dir>

<p align="justify">(2) That the pledgor or mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing pledged or mortgaged; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) That the persons constituting the pledge or mortgage have the free disposal of their property, and in the absence thereof, that they be legally authorized for the purpose. </p>
</dir>
<p align="justify">Third persons who are not parties to the principal obligation may secure the latter by pledging or mortgaging their own property. (1857) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2086.</b> The provisions of article 2052 are applicable to a pledge or mortgage. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2087.</b> It is also of the essence of these contracts that when the principal obligation becomes due, the things in which the pledge or mortgage consists may be alienated for the payment to the creditor. (1858) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2088.</b> The creditor cannot appropriate the things given by way of pledge or mortgage, or dispose of them. Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void. (1859a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2089.</b> A pledge or mortgage is indivisible, even though the debt may be divided among the successors in interest of the debtor or of the creditor. </p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, the debtor's heir who has paid a part of the debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as long as the debt is not completely satisfied. </p>
<p align="justify">Neither can the creditor's heir who received his share of the debt return the pledge or cancel the mortgage, to the prejudice of the other heirs who have not been paid. </p>
<p align="justify">From these provisions is excepted the case in which, there being several things given in mortgage or pledge, each one of them guarantees only a determinate portion of the credit. </p>
<p align="justify">The debtor, in this case, shall have a right to the extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the portion of the debt for which each thing is specially answerable is satisfied. (1860) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2090.</b> The indivisibility of a pledge or mortgage is not affected by the fact that the debtors are not solidarily liable. (n) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 2092.</b> A promise to constitute a pledge or mortgage gives rise only to a personal action between the contracting parties, without prejudice to the criminal responsibility incurred by him who defrauds another, by offering in pledge or mortgage as unencumbered, things which he knew were subject to some burden, or by misrepresenting himself to be the owner of the same. (1862) </p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER 2<br/>Pledge</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2093.</b> In addition to the requisites prescribed in article 2085, it is necessary, in order to constitute the contract of pledge, that the thing pledged be placed in the possession of the creditor, or of a third person by common agreement. (1863) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2094.</b> All movables which are within commerce may be pledged, provided they are susceptible of possession. (1864) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 2097.</b> With the consent of the pledgee, the thing pledged may be alienated by the pledgor or owner, subject to the pledge. The ownership of the thing pledged is transmitted to the vendee or transferee as soon as the pledgee consents to the alienation, but the latter shall continue in possession. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2098.</b> The contract of pledge gives a right to the creditor to retain the thing in his possession or in that of a third person to whom it has been delivered, until the debt is paid. (1866a) </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 2101.</b> The pledgor has the same responsibility as a bailor in commodatum in the case under article 1951. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2102.</b> If the pledge earns or produces fruits, income, dividends, or interests, the creditor shall compensate what he receives with those which are owing him; but if none are owing him, or insofar as the amount may exceed that which is due, he shall apply it to the principal. Unless there is a stipulation to the contrary, the pledge shall extend to the interest and earnings of the right pledged. </p>
<p align="justify">In case of a pledge of animals, their offspring shall pertain to the pledgor or owner of animals pledged, but shall be subject to the pledge, if there is no stipulation to the contrary. (1868a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2103.</b> Unless the thing pledged is expropriated, the debtor continues to be the owner thereof. </p>
<p align="justify">Nevertheless, the creditor may bring the actions which pertain to the owner of the thing pledged in order to recover it from, or defend it against a third person. (1869) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2104.</b> The creditor cannot use the thing pledged, without the authority of the owner, and if he should do so, or should misuse the thing in any other way, the owner may ask that it be judicially or extrajudicially deposited. When the preservation of the thing pledged requires its use, it must be used by the creditor but only for that purpose. (1870a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2105.</b> The debtor cannot ask for the return of the thing pledged against the will of the creditor, unless and until he has paid the debt and its interest, with expenses in a proper case. (1871) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2106.</b> If through the negligence or wilful act of the pledgee, the thing pledged is in danger of being lost or impaired, the pledgor may require that it be deposited with a third person. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2107.</b> If there are reasonable grounds to fear the destruction or impairment of the thing pledged, without the fault of the pledgee, the pledgor may demand the return of the thing, upon offering another thing in pledge, provided the latter is of the same kind as the former and not of inferior quality, and without prejudice to the right of the pledgee under the provisions of the following article. </p>
<p align="justify">The pledgee is bound to advise the pledgor, without delay, of any danger to the thing pledged. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2108.</b> If, without the fault of the pledgee, there is danger of destruction, impairment, or diminution in value of the thing pledged, he may cause the same to be sold at a public sale. The proceeds of the auction shall be a security for the principal obligation in the same manner as the thing originally pledged. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2109.</b> If the creditor is deceived on the substance or quality of the thing pledged, he may either claim another thing in its stead, or demand immediate payment of the principal obligation. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2110.</b> If the thing pledged is returned by the pledgee to the pledgor or owner, the pledge is extinguished. Any stipulation to the contrary shall be void. </p>
<p align="justify">If subsequent to the perfection of the pledge, the thing is in the possession of the pledgor or owner, there is a prima facie presumption that the same has been returned by the pledgee. This same presumption exists if the thing pledged is in the possession of a third person who has received it from the pledgor or owner after the constitution of the pledge. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2111.</b> A statement in writing by the pledgee that he renounces or abandons the pledge is sufficient to extinguish the pledge. For this purpose, neither the acceptance by the pledgor or owner, nor the return of the thing pledged is necessary, the pledgee becoming a depositary. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2112.</b> The creditor to whom the credit has not been satisfied in due time, may proceed before a Notary Public to the sale of the thing pledged. This sale shall be made at a public auction, and with notification to the debtor and the owner of the thing pledged in a proper case, stating the amount for which the public sale is to be held. If at the first auction the thing is not sold, a second one with the same formalities shall be held; and if at the second auction there is no sale either, the creditor may appropriate the thing pledged. In this case he shall be obliged to give an acquittance for his entire claim. (1872a) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2113.</b> At the public auction, the pledgor or owner may bid. He shall, moreover, have a better right if he should offer the same terms as the highest bidder. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Article 2114.</b> All bids at the public auction shall offer to pay the purchase price at once. If any other bid is accepted, the pledgee is deemed to have been received the purchase price, as far as the pledgor or owner is concerned. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2115.</b> The sale of the thing pledged shall extinguish the principal obligation, whether or not the proceeds of the sale are equal to the amount of the principal obligation, interest and expenses in a proper case. If the price of the sale is more than said amount, the debtor shall not be entitled to the excess, unless it is otherwise agreed. If the price of the sale is less, neither shall the creditor be entitled to recover the deficiency, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary. (n) </p>

If a third party secures an obligation by pledging his own movable property under the provisions of article 2085 he shall have the same rights as a guarantor under articles 2066 to 2070, and articles 2077 to 2081. He is not prejudiced by any waiver of defense by the principal obligor. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2121.</b> Pledges created by operation of law, such as those referred to in articles 546, 1731, and 1994, are governed by the foregoing articles on the possession, care and sale of the thing as well as on the termination of the pledge. However, after payment of the debt and expenses, the remainder of the price of the sale shall be delivered to the obligor. (n) </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Article 2122.</b> A thing under a pledge by operation of law may be sold only after demand of the amount for which the thing is retained.
