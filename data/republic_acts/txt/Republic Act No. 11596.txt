AN ACT PROHIBITING THE PRACTICE OF CHILD MARRIAGE AND IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled:

Section 1. Declaration of State Policy.  Consistent with Section 13, Article II of the Philippine Constitution, the State recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building and promotes and protects their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, and social well-being. In the pursuit of this policy, the State shall abolish all traditional and cultural practices and structures that perpetuate discrimination, abuse and exploitation of children such as the practice of child marriage.

Further, the State recognizes the role of women in nation-building and shall therefore protect and promote their empowerment.ℒαwρhi৷ This entails the abolition of the unequal structures and practices the perpetuate discrimination and inequality.

The State affirms the human rights of children consistent with its obligations under (1) international conventions to which the Philippines is a State Party, including the (a) Universal Declaration of Human Rights; (b) Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages; (c) UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; (d) Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); (e) Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography; and (f) Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; and (2) domestic laws like Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.

The State affirms that marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of capacitated parties, and child betrothal and marriage shall have no legal effect.

Pursuant to these policies, the State thus views child marriage as a practice constituting child abuse because it debases, degrades, and demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of children.
